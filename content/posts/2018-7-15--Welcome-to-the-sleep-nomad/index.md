Welcome to the sleep nomad. This blog is focused on sleep of course. It is a culmination of all of the things I have tried in the last 8+ years to sleep better since being diagnosed with sleep apnea. It is not solely focus on sleep apnea but it will be a major part of the posts here. I have found that sleep issues seem to be intertwinded. Sleep apnea can be mixed at times with insomnia in my experience.

Because of that, I have tried a plethera of things to both improve my sleep apnea and combat the bouts of insomnia that seem to come with it. I am one to experiment so if something seems like it might help and doesn't seem to cause harm, I will give it a go.

The results are of course a trial group of one. So while something may or may not work for me, it certainly might have the opposite effect on you. So please be your own nomad and see what works best for you.

### What you won't read about on this blog.

We all know that lack of sleep and sleep apnea have adverse health effects. I see no reason to focus on that aspect as it can just cause more concern and anxiety when you are already dealing with a sleep issue. The goal here is to get better sleep and avoid all of the side effects so let us keep it positive!

Dogma! Another thing that you will not read about on this blog is a focus on one avenue as the "only way" or the "perfect way". If we don't experiment and keep an open mind, we are going to be stuck exactly where we are. To progress forward, we must constantly ask the question, "is there a better way?" Many of the things I have tried are a result of that philosophy.

Thanks for joining me on this journey. I look forward to hearing from you. Please contact me using the contact page and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I hope to have a comment system set up in the future so that we can share based on the content of each post. I am still looking to find the right solution to implement. If you have a comment system you like, please let me know.
